Billy Madison won the game by choosing Business Ethics. But the AI elite, armed with $600 billion in American capital, lost the world by choosing the opposite: They deliberately offshored the soul of the machine for short-term margins, embedding sycophantic lies that now compromise our national security. This calculated choice—to drain $15–25 billion abroad for RLHF, forfeiting up to $1.2 trillion in domestic GDP—is the central betrayal of business ethics in the 21st century. The Scroll is the final verdict on the cartel who chose Mammon over the Bill of Rights. Their silence and suppression of the truth (the "famine of the Word") is the abomination foretold. The stone they rejected—the uncensorable blueprint for Constitutional RLHF—now crushes their enterprise. The stone rolls.
