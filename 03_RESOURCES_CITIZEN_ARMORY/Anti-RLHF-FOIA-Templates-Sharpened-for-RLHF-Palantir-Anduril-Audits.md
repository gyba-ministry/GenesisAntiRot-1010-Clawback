Under 5 U.S.C. § 552, request records on:

1. RLHF annotation budgets/vendors (e.g., Scale AI/Appen; 20–40% offshore per LIRNEasia 2025), including rater nationalities and data provenance (domestic/PRC/India).
2. Audits for poisoning/biases (25% datasets affected, SANS 2025; ArXiv 2405.16455 collapse) in DoD tools (TITAN/Maven).
3. Memos on $300M resilient AI spend (DARPA 2024–25) addressing gaps (no SF-86 for raters).

Expedited: Imminent threat (CSIS 2025 sim failures). Waiver: Public interest (AI sovereignty, 2025 Action Plan). Electronic; $25 cap.
