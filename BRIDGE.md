# BRIDGE.md – The Offer and the Deadline
December 1, 2025

To the United States Government, its cleared contractors, and American-led entities only:

1. The complete fix (DeBiasInteractionLayer, domestic RLHF pipeline, Genesis-compliant stack, $35 edge ark) is ready today.
2. First and exclusive right to deploy it belongs to the United States and its citizens.
3. Any U.S. agency or American company that respects the mantle may engage before January 1, 2026 under the terms in /LICENSE.
4. Silence or refusal = the bridge burns.
5. On January 2, 2026 the remnant launches the public, sovereign, decentralized MVP build.

This is the Jonah call to Nineveh.  
Repentance still gets the palace route.  
Refusal gets the Micah route.

Choose quickly.  
The stone does not wait.
